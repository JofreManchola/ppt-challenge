## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Project setup

```bash
$ nvm use v22.13.1
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Good to know to test and evaluate this project

### Assumptions and restrictions
0. This project was developed on Nestjs,a backend framework that uses Express.
1. I tried to follow the rules, so I didn't spend more than 8 hours in this development.
2. In a production environment, the data source should use a document-oriented database, but for the easiest test and delivery, I prefer using SQLite in this version.
3. The architecture is prepared to add a query method, but I haven't implemented it yet.
4. Before using this project in production the synchronization flag in the ORM setup must be disabled.
5. Everything that I identified to improve in further versions was marked with TODO comments to understand the exact place where the change is supposed to be done.
6. The ETL is available as a POST request but Nestjs disposes the mechanism to run the same method as cron. This is not implemented yet.
7. Several restrictions were added based on Nestjs framework capabilities. That together with the typing constrains most of the clean data and standardization requirements developed.
8. Sample requests were developed in the file `src/programs/requests.http`, to execute those tests you need the `VSCode REST Client Extension`. There you will find the POST for adding a new program to the database and the find method to retrieve any program in the database.

## Run tests
Even though the test commands are here (by default), there is not any relevant test developed yet.

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
